--- TO DO ---

Improvements for REV B:
- Integrate Buzzer onto PCB
- Make more room for mounting hole (esp. left bottom)
- Indicate polarity of secondary power pins (3V3, 5V, 12V)
- Add 24-Pin MOLEX Connector (ATX power supply)
- Add polyfuses
- Change UART connector --> reverse polarity protection
- Maybe: Move Flash closer to uC
- Maybe: Get rid of need for secondary power pins (--> better power distribution)
 

--- NOTES ---

- A/D-Converter at 10 SPS: Source Impedance should be less than 1e9 Ohm
- PortD PD6 and PD7 are USB D+ and D- lines.
- Include SD Card Reader as internal storage
- Heatbed NTC is Type EPCOS 100K Thermistor (B57560G1104F)

- 3x Fan Controller with 1 LED each:
	-> 1x Extruder 
	-> 1x Hotend 
	-> 1x Filament
 
- 3x Thermistor-Input:
	-> 1x Heatbed 
	-> 1x Extruder 
	-> 1x Housing
	
- Heatbed Controller
	-> 2 channels: Extruder, Heatbed
	-> High Current (25A) MOSFETs 
	-> 1 LED each

- LEDs
	-> 1x Power indicator
	-> 1x Working indicator
	-> 1 per Stepper Driver?

- Connectors:
	-> USB
	-> LCD (16x2 Characters)
	-> JTAG
	-> ISP

- LCD Connector: Define pin layout
- USB Interface: Shield capacitively coupled to GND?
- What does the "enable"-bit do on the stepper motor drivers? Maybe just hardwire them to a switch instead of <wasting> uc-pins?
