--- TO DO ---
 
- 3x Fan Controller with 1 LED each:
	-> 1x Extruder 
	-> 1x Hotend 
	-> 1x Filament
 
- 3x Thermistor-Input:
	-> 1x Heatbed 
	-> 1x Extruder 
	-> 1x Housing
---> 3.3V operation: 4.7k resistors in series?


- Heatbed Controller
	-> 2 channels: Extruder, Heatbed
	-> High Current (25A) MOSFETs 
	-> 1 LED each

- LEDs
	-> 1x Power indicator
	-> 1x Working indicator
	-> 1 per Stepper Driver?

- Connectors:
	-> USB
	-> LCD (16x2 Characters)
	-> JTAG
	-> ISP

- LCD Connector: Define pin layout
- USB Interface: Shield capacitively coupled to GND?
- What does the "enable"-bit do on the stepper motor drivers? Maybe just hardwire them to a switch instead of <wasting> uc-pins?

--- Missing on parts list ---
- Fans
- Connectors
- Transistor BCV 27 SMD

--- NOTES ---

- A/D-Converter at 10 SPS: Source Impedance should be less than 1e9 Ohm

- PortD PD6 and PD7 are USB D+ and D- lines.

- Include SD Card Reader as internal storage
